# mtn_game

This is a game I'm making for fun, to learn, and to build a portfolio. 

I'm pretty new to python so any feedback or suggestions is most welcome and greatly appreciated!

Mtn_game.py is the main run file, rooms, characters and merchants contain respective classes and class data. 

Currently this is a rough draft, proof of concept, and i am working to reformat, clean up and debug all the code before adding more features like monsters, bosses, and a battle system.

Im trying to keep all the classes as modular as possible so that they can easily be reused or adapted as the game develops and changes. 

Using idle s my main editor, kind of poking around and using atom sometimes.
