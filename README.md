# mtn_game

This is a game I'm making for fun, to learn, and to build a portfolio. 

I'm currently exploring pythons builtin functions and implementing them as working examples in this game. Currently exploring open(), which i will use to allow the user to save and load their character. Also the IO functions, and probably tkinter soon as i want to be able to easily and dynamically utilize user input (i.e. replace the current text-based input system)

I'm pretty new to python so any feedback or suggestions is most welcome and greatly appreciated!
